	<h2>Azure Sentinel start guide</h2>
	<h3>This tutorial is made for people who have installed Azure Sentinel and now want to start analyzing their data.</h3>

	<h4>To first start collecting data from your environment, start on Configuration - Data connectors</h4>
	<p>Here you find a list with all the possible data sources you can connect to Azure Sentinel. 
	This includes Windows Events, Linux or server syslogs, Firewall Applications, and many more.</p>
	<figure>
	<img class="large" alt="Connector_List" title="Connector_List" src="media/Connector_List.png"/>

	</figure>
	
	<p>Select the data source you want to collect data from and press the <img src="media/Connector.png"/> at the bottom.</p>
	<p>Every connector has an instruction page for the requirements and how to gather data in Azure Sentinel. 
	For example, to gather Windows logs you have to install a Microsoft Monitoring Agent on the system, which can then be found in <b>Control Panel - System and Security - Microsoft Monitoring Agent</b></p>
	<p>For Virtual Machines in Azure, you can just select an available VM from the list and no extra steps have to be taken.</p>
	<p>After you've followed the instructions page, you can get started with your data.</p>
	
	<h4>To start analyzing the collected data from your environment, go to Configuration - Analytics</h4>
	<p>There are over 100 Rule templates which can be enabled to protect against low to high severity threats.</p>

	</figure>
	
	<p>You can also create your own custom rules using the Kusto Query Language, KQL, much like SQL.</p>
	<p>For all these rules you can set an automated response to resolve common threats using playbooks you have to create yourself.</p>
	
	<h4>When one of the Analytics rules you just enabled is triggered, it will show up in Threat management - Incidents</h4>
	<p>In this tab you can focus on threat details, such as accounts and hosts involved, and all data from the run query.</p>
	
	<p>Another important part is <b>Threat management - Workbooks</b>, these are visual representations of data collected, customizable dashboards
	for a clean look and the most important data for you. There are again templates available for people who are just getting started.</p>

	<p>To configure the automated responses of Azure Sentinel, we use <b>Configuration - Playbooks</b>. Here we can set the responses to a triggered alert.</p>
	<p>To trigger an automatic response for Azure Sentinel alerts, use the search function to look for "Azure Sentinel" and select the "When a response to an Azure Sentinel alert is triggered (Preview)"</p>

	<p>From here we can search for other actions to take on certain alerts such as mailing the alert, creating a ticket, integration with other products, etc.</p>
	<p>These playbooks will now be available as a list when creating an analytics rule.</p>
